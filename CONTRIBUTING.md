## Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code.
- Prefer `type` aliases over `interface` for type definitions.
- Use **React functional components** and hooks.
- Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
- Always end names of TypeScript types with `Props` (e.g., `ButtonProps`).
- When having a useEffect and useState in the same component, prefer to make a custom hook.
- Use more specific types instead of any where possible.
